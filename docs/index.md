# caridea/dispatch

üç§ Caridea is a miniscule PHP application library. This shrimpy fellow is what you'd use when you just want some helping hands and not a full-blown framework.

This is its [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) and [PSR-15](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/) compliant request handler, with a few middleware implementations.

* [The runner](01-runner.md)
* [The priority runner](02-priority.md)
* [Middleware](03-middleware.md)
